# TinyURL


Temporary Notes to self
**Stack**

- MERN Stack
- PHP with SQL database
- Nextjs with ReactJS app → backend?

**API**

- POST → send long URL, check if it’s already cached, returns shortened URL
- DELETE → send long URL or shortened, delete from backend

**Frontend**

- Simple UI
- Textbox to insert long URL, button to right, Show shortened URL below,
- Can store URLs? → place on the right or left-hand side
- Separate text box below, delete button to right, just states completed below

Whenever user attempts to reach shortened URL, redirects them to longer URL
